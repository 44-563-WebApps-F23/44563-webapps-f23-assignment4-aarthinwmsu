        <h4>PLAYNAME : An Enemy of the People Act 5</h4>
        <h4>AUTHOR : Henrik Ibsen</h4>

        Dr. Stockmann (laughing and rubbing his hands). She didn't dare do otherwise, either! It's delicious!<br>

        Mrs. Stockmann. Well, after the dreadful scenes last night<br>

        Petra. It was not only that. Just listen to this, father!<br>

        Dr. Stockmann. Well?<br>

        Petra. Mrs. Busk showed me no less than three letters she received this morning<br>

        Dr. Stockmann. Anonymous, I suppose?<br>

        Petra. Yes.<br>

        Dr. Stockmann. Yes, because they didn't dare to risk signing their names, Katherine!<br>
