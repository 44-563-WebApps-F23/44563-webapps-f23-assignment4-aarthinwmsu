        <h4>PLAYNAME : An Enemy of the People Act 5</h4>
        <h4>AUTHOR : Henrik Ibsen</h4>

        Dr. Stockmann. We won't live in such a disgusting hole any longer. Pack up as quickly as you can, Katherine; the sooner we can get away, the better.<br>

        Mrs. Stockmann. Be quiet—I think I hear someone in the hall. See who it is, Petra.<br>

        Petra (opening the door). Oh, it's you, Captain Horster! Do come in.<br>

        Horster (coming in). Good morning. I thought I would just come in and see how you were.<br>

        Dr. Stockmann (shaking his hand). Thanks—that is really kind of you.<br>

        Mrs. Stockmann. And thank you, too, for helping us through the crowd, Captain Horster.<br>

        Petra. How did you manage to get home again?<br>
