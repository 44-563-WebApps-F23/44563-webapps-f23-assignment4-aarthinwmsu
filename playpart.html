        <h5>Dr. Stockmann. </h5>
        <p>We won't live in such a disgusting hole any longer. Pack up as quickly as you can, Katherine; the sooner we can get away, the better.
        </p>
        
        
        <h5>Mrs. Stockmann. </h5>
        <p>Be quiet—I think I hear someone in the hall. See who it is, Petra.</p>
        
        
        <h5>Petra.</h5>
        <p>[opening the door]<br>
        Oh, it's you, Captain Horster! Do come in.
        </p>

        
        <h5>Horster.</h5>
        <p>[coming in]<br>
        Good morning. I thought I would just come in and see how you were.
        </p>

        
        <h5>Dr. Stockmann.</h5>
        <p>[shaking his hand]<br>
        Thanks—that is really kind of you.
        </p>

        
        <h5>Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
        <p>
        And thank you, too, for helping us through the crowd, Captain Horster.
        </p>

    
        <h5>Petra. </h5>
        <p>How did you manage to get home again?
        </p>
